# DCGAN on CIFAR-10

## Overview
This project trains a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Dataset Preprocessing
- CIFAR-10 images are resized to `32x32` pixels.
- Images are normalized to `[-1,1]` for stable GAN training.

## Training the Model
### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**
